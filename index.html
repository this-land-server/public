			<h1>This Land</h1>
			<p>This land is a fertile land! We shall rule over this land, and we shall call it... This Land!</p>

			<h2>Rules</h2>

			<p>Better rules coming soon, but generally:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Respect each other. Don't make us need a full Code of Conduct immediately</li>
				<li>Don't take things from other players unless they've given you permission</li>
				<li>Don't make changes to other players buildings without their permission (reversible pranks are fine if the person will find them funny. If in doubt, don't)</li>
				<li>If you have operator privileges, don't use them to spawn items or add/remove blocks</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Joining</h2>
			<p>We only accept people that somebody on the server properly knows. If this is you, then ask that person to refer you to the server admins.</p>
